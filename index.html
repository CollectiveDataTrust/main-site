            <p>that moves the information economy.</p>
            <p>You are the reason for the existence of internet.</p>
            <p>You are the reason for the existence of machines.</p>
            <p>You should have a say on the evolution of both.</p>
            <p>We believe that your data is your property,</p>

            <p>We understand how vulnerable you are in this situation. </p>
            <p>And we can not expect that all users will give up to their lifestyle and needs, just to protect their data</p>

            <p>Is not about the money that some big company is making out of your data; Or the fact that is not paying you for
              it.
            </p>
            <p>Is about the fact that it won’t allow you to participate in the decisions that affects you as the user.</p>

            <p>We don’t see much of a choice out there, all alternatives seems to be the same.</p>
            <p>And we know, that no solution will ever work, unless it puts you - the owner of the data - in full control of
              it.
            </p>
            <p>This is not an issue of policies and regulations, this is an issue of

          <div class="text-justify">
            <p>This is (The) Collective Data Trust.</p>
            <p>We are a community of internet users, and we care so much about Artificial Intelligence development, and Data
              Monetization practices, that we have created the Collective Data Trust (CDT).</p>
            <p>CDT provides to internet users the possibility to protect their data and other digital assets, and to take advantage
              from any monetization process that occurs involving his data, becoming the owners of the company that monetizes
              each user’s data, through the strategic implementation of a collaborative model for the development of Artificial
              Intelligence and Collective Data Monetization.</p>
            <p>The Trust is a fiduciary entity, legally established under the State of Delaware, with registration No. 6855308,
              and by which, once you sign in, you become a beneficiary, and you are entitled to ownership over the trust
              assets, proportionally to your own asset integration. By becoming a Beneficiary of the Trust, the user is turned
              into owner.</p>
            <p>You will own a part of a set of companies without paying any money.</p>
            <p>You will select which data to integrate and how it will be used. </p>
            <p>You entitle these companies to use your data to create and capture value.</p>
            <p>Such value is used by the companies to generate profit for you.</p>
            <p>The shareholder of such companies is The Trust, and profits are distributed only to its beneficiaries</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading text-uppercase">How</h2>
          <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted"></h3>
          <div class="text-justify">
            <p>Imagine that someone could pay you just for existing, and sharing some information about your existence</p>
            <br/>
            <p>CDT looks to contribute with a global passive income, but instead of hopping for some social justice or claiming
              over economics rights, we take the system as it is, and we look for ways to make it happen. So we focus on
              the possibility that Data has to produce income to its owners.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>By signing in, you become owner of the company that monetizes your data.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>There is a contract by which you can become owner, with all the entitlement of a founder, and the right to vote.
              Where, instead of investing money or any other financial assets for your shares, you are integrating your data
              as an asset, that will be collectively monetized along with the data of all the other beneficiaries.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>By Monetization we refer to processes aligned to our mission, that will create and increase the use value or
              the exchange value of the collective data, either through products development in the field of Artificial Intelligence,
              or through applied services like marketing and research.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Once you have signed in, you are no longer just an user, you are the owner.</p>
            <p>The kind of assets that the user contributes as settlement to become a beneficiary is not his money, but his
              data</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Once the owners accumulates a critical mass of data into the collective digital assets, the Trust, can optimize
              monetization process and start giving tangible results to the owners. </p>

            <p>At the same time, this mass of data will be used to train and enhance artificial intelligence powered services
              and products, that will be at the service of the beneficiaries and under the individual control of each of
              them.</p>

            <p>There are many ways you can benefit from the Trust, and since all benefits are based on the use of Data-as-an-Asset
              to create value, we refer to this processes as the Collective Data Monetization System, where we secure a private
              and safe environment for a user-based, data-centric distributed economy, beneficial to all its participants.</p>

            <h4>Each beneficiary can participate in different ways:</h4>


            <h5> Passive monetization: </h5>
            <p>You choose what you will like to share, and we will create value out of it.</p>

            <h5>Active Monetization: </h5>
            <p>Teach the machine, answer paid questions, participate in rewarded research campaigns, and sell specifically demanded
              data, under your own terms.</p>
            <h5>The Collective Data Trust will execute work on 3 main missions:</h5>
            <ol>
              <li>Monetize and Increase the value of the collective data for the Beneficiaries, to provide them with a source
                of passive income, and the additional possibility to actively generate income through different business
                opportunities across the platform.</li>

              <li>Democratize Artificial Intelligence resources access, providing each beneficiary with its own personal and
                private Artificial Intelligence development platform, and allowing the community to have a collective intelligence
                platform, owned by all the beneficiaries.</li>

              <li>Advocate and Pursue a fair access to internet for the Beneficiaries, and represent the best interest of the
                community in all fields where possible.</li>
