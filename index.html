          </p>

          <p>Collective Data Trust is a fiduciary entity, legally established under the State of Delaware, with registration
            No. 6855308, and by which, once you sign in, you become a beneficiary, and you are entitled to ownership over

          <h2 class="section-heading">How</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-6 text-right">
          <p> Imagine that someone could pay you just for existing, and sharing some information about your existence </p>
          <p>CDT looks to contribute with a global passive income, but instead of hopping for some social justice or claiming
            over economics rights, we take the system as it is, and we look for ways to make it happen. So we focus on the
            possibility that Data has to produce income to its owners.</p>
          <p>By signing in, you become owner of the company that monetizes your data.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-6 text-left">
          <p>Instead of investing money or any other financial assets for your shares, you are integrating your data as an asset,
            that will be collectively monetized along with the data of all the other beneficiaries.</p>
          <p>By Monetization we refer to processes aligned to our mission, that will create and increase the use value or the
            exchange value of the collective data, either through products development in the field of Artificial Intelligence,
            or through direct monetization and applied services like marketing and research.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-6"></div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-6"></div>
        <div class="col-sm-6 text-right">
          <p>Once you have signed in, you are no longer just an user, you are the owner.</p>

          <p>The kind of assets that the user contributes as settlement to become a beneficiary is not his money, but his data
          </p>

          <p>Once the owners accumulates a critical mass of data into the collective digital assets, the Trust, can optimize
            monetization process and start giving tangible results to the owners.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-6 text-left">
          <p>At the same time, this mass of data will be used to train and enhance artificial intelligence powered services
            and products, that will be at the service of the beneficiaries and under the individual control of each of them.
          </p>

          <p>There are many ways you can benefit from the Trust, and since all benefits are based on the use of Data-as-an-Asset
            to create value, we refer to this processes as the Collective Data Monetization System, where we secure a private
            and safe environment for a user-based, data-centric distributed economy, beneficial to all its participants.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-6 text-left"></div>
      </div>
      <p>Each beneficiary can participate in different ways:</p>

      <p>
        <b>Passive monetization: </b>
      </p>
      <p>You choose what you will like to share, and we will create value out of it.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Active Monetization: </b>
      </p>
      <p>Teach the machine, answer paid questions, participate in rewarded research campaigns, and sell specifically demanded
        data, under your own terms.</p>

      <p>The Collective Data Trust will execute work on 3 main missions:</p>

      <p>Monetize and Increase the value of the collective data for the Beneficiaries, to provide them with a source of passive
        income, and the additional possibility to actively generate income through different business opportunities across
        the platform.</p>

      <p>Democratize Artificial Intelligence resources access, providing each beneficiary with its own personal and private
        Artificial Intelligence development platform, and allowing the community to have a collective intelligence platform,
        owned by all the beneficiaries.</p>

      <p>Advocate and Pursue a fair access to internet for the Beneficiaries, and represent the best interest of the community
        in all fields where possible.</p>

      <p>
        <b>WHY A TRUST? </b>
      </p>

      <p>For legal and customary reasons, a Trust is the perfect instrument to hold assets under a legal structure, and to hold
        those who manage the assets, accountable for management and allocation.</p>

      <p>In this way, each beneficiary is owner of his part of the trust, which is proportional to his digital assets representation
        on the trust, and to how much this represents to the total digital assets of all the beneficiaries together.
